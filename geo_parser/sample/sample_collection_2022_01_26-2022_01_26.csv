However, the functional role of miR-3662 in human cancers remains a topic of debate. First, our bioinformatic analysis in the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset showed that miR-3662 expression is higher in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and African American breast cancer than in other types of breast cancer. Next, we found that inhibition or knockout of endogenous mature miR-3662 in human TNBC cells suppresses cell proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Functional analysis revealed that knockout of miR-3662 reduces the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in TNBC cells. Finally, using dual-luciferase assay, miRNA/mRNA immunoprecipitation assay, and CRISPR-mediated miR-3662 activation and repression, we further identified that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP-1), a Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, is a direct target of miR-3662 and is most likely responsible for miR-3662-mediated TNBC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that miR-3662 plays an oncogenic role in tumor progression and metastasis via a miR-3662-HBP1 axis, which negatively regulates Wnt /β-catenin signaling pathway in TNBC cells.', 'Series/Type': 'Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing', 'Series/Overall-Design': 'total RNA expression by deep-sequencing in MDA-MB-231 sorted for different levels of miR-3662 activity', 'Series/Status/Release-Date': '2022-01-26', 'Series/Status/Last-Update-Date': '2022-01-26', 'Series/Pubmed-ID': '34728806', 'Sample/Channel/Characteristics': '', 'Sample/Relation': 'SRX10372553; SRX10372554; SRX10372555; SRX10372556'}	{'match_res0': {'Series/Title0': ['CRISPR']}, 'match_res1': {'Series/Title1': ['cancer'], 'Series/Summary1': ['Cancer', 'cancer']}, 'match_res2': {}}
